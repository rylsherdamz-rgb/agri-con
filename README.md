# Agri-Block

Agricultural forward contracts on Stellar with crop NFTs, escrow settlement, satellite-gated buyability, and disaster aid.

## Project Description

Agri-Block is a decentralized marketplace for agricultural forward contracts built on Stellar. Farmers mint crop NFTs representing real parcels, satellite NDVI verification gates buyability, and XLM escrow protects both parties through delivery. Built with Soroban smart contracts, openEO satellite data, and an AI assistant for crop guidance.

## Project Vision

Democratize access to formal agricultural commodity markets for smallholder farmers worldwide by replacing trust-dependent paper contracts with verifiable, on-chain infrastructure — where crop health is provable via satellite, payments are escrowed programmatically, and every transaction leaves an immutable audit trail.

## Key Features

- **Crop NFTs** — Farmers mint NFTs representing crop parcels with metadata (crop type, quantity, price, region)
- **Satellite Verification** — NDVI analysis via Copernicus Sentinel-2 (openEO) gated by **X402 micro-payment** (0.1 XLM). All farmers auto-verified on signup.
- **XLM Escrow** — Buyers pay XLM; 20% upfront to farmer, 70% held in escrow until delivery, 10% to disaster treasury
- **Disaster Aid** — Farmers file claims for crop loss; on-chain proof of damage
- **AI Assistant** — NVIDIA NIM-powered chat for agricultural guidance

## How It Works

```
Farmer draws parcel on map → Mints crop NFT → NDVI check via satellite → Listing becomes buyable
       ↓                                                                           ↓
  Buyer purchases with XLM (20% upfront, 70% escrow, 10% treasury)          Delivery verified
       ↓                                                                           ↓
  Escrow released to farmer OR refunded to buyer (disaster/fraud)
```

1. **Farm** — Farmer signs up (auto-verified), draws their parcel on the interactive map
2. **Mint** — Fills crop details (type, quantity, price, harvest date) and mints a crop NFT on Stellar
3. **Verify** — Runs NDVI analysis via Copernicus Sentinel-2 (openEO) — gated by an X402 micro-payment (0.1 XLM) to cover API costs. Admin records attestation on-chain; if NDVI passes threshold, listing becomes buyable
4. **Market** — Listing appears in the marketplace for buyers to browse
5. **Buy** — Buyer purchases with XLM. 20% goes to farmer upfront, 70% held in escrow, 10% to disaster treasury pool
6. **Deliver** — Farmer ships the harvest; buyer confirms delivery
7. **Settle** — Escrow released to farmer on successful delivery; refunded to buyer if disaster or fraud

### Contract Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `mint_crop_nft_with_listing` | Mint a new crop NFT with listing metadata |
| `buy_crop_nft` | Purchase a listed crop NFT (XLM escrow) |
| `record_satellite_attestation` | Record NDVI attestation, sets buyability |
| `set_farmer_profile_verified` | Admin-signed on-chain verification |
| `submit_proof` | File a disaster proof for a crop |
| `verify_delivery` | Validator confirms delivery |
| `get_crop` | Read crop metadata |
