## 1. Architecture Overview

The ecosystem has three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        SKILLS (Top Level)                        │
│  Invoked via Skill tool or /slash-command. Entry point for all   │
│  structured workflows. Skills may call agents as sub-processes.  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                      AGENTS (Execution Layer)                     │
│  Launched via Agent tool. Each has a specific lens/expertise.    │
│  Agents do the actual work: review, design, analyze, verify.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                      WORKFLOWS (Orchestration)                    │
│  Scripts that compose agents into deterministic pipelines.       │
│  Fan-out, verify, synthesize. Used for large-scale tasks.        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 5. Skill Invocation Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** — brainstorming, systematic-debugging determine HOW
2. **Analysis skills second** — agentic-council, decision-council for multi-perspective
3. **Implementation skills third** — feature-dev, pr-review-toolkit, platform skills

**Red Flag Check:** Before acting, ask: "Might any skill apply?" Even 1% chance = invoke it.
